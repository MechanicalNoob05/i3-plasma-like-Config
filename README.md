# MAIN GOALS
The main goal of this project is to get a KDE desktop which is pleasing to look at and work in as well as resource efficient. I do have several other applictions wich have the semi-transperent effect to it such as Thunderbird, etc. It is great for those who want to have eye candy with minimum overhaul on the system.
